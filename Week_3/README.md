# **Week 3 Tasks: Mobile Manipulator & URDF Enhancement**

## **Overview**

This week, our goal is to integrate an **OpenManipulator robotic arm** with the **TurtleBot Waffle Pi** to create a mobile manipulator. The interns will work collaboratively following a structured Git workflow.

The Resources for Week 3 are in the Supporting Material Directory. Check all Assembly files and Helping Material from there.

### **Git Workflow:**

1. **Fork** the repository from GitHub.
2. **Clone** the forked repository to your local machine.
3. Work on assigned tasks and **push** updates to your repository.
4. Regularly submit **pull requests (PRs)** to the main repository.
5. Keep your fork **synced** with the main repository after each merge.

## **Tasks**

### **Task 1: Mobile Manipulator Assembly in SolidWorks** & Create URDF for the Mobile Manipulator (Collaborative Task)

- Import the **OpenManipulator** and **TurtleBot Waffle Pi** assemblies.
- Remove the **LiDAR sensor** from TurtleBot and reposition it slightly forward.
- Mount the **OpenManipulator** on the **TurtleBot** to create a mobile manipulator.
- Ensure all constraints and mates are correctly applied for a stable assembly.

- Convert the completed **SolidWorks assembly** into a **URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)**.
- Define proper **links, joints, and physical properties**.
- Validate the URDF by visualizing it in **RViz** or a simulator like Gazebo.

------

### **Task 3: Understanding and Adding Sensors to a URDF**

- Study **URDF structure** and how **sensors** are integrated.
- Modify the **SimBot mobile robotâ€™s URDF** to add new sensors (e.g., LiDAR, camera).
- Ensure correct placement and orientation of sensors in the URDF file.
- Test in **RViz** or **Gazebo** to verify sensor placements.

------

## **Submission Guidelines**

- Commit your work **regularly** to your GitHub repository.
- Submit **pull requests** for review at regular intervals.
- Merge updates from the main repository frequently.
- Ensure proper documentation in your commits and PR descriptions.

### **Deadline:** Work at your Pace :)

Letâ€™s make this an exciting and productive week! ðŸš€
